## Description
Invasive species are a serious problem in the ecosystems in which they become established, and can lead to the extinction of local species, especially endangered ones. Here, we propose a solution, called Evern, to provide camera monitoring in natural areas. The services, created under the ITIL framework, aim to detect invasive species based on a classification process performed by Artificial Intelligence, and notify the threat to the contracting client using a message distributor and an integration framework. The implemented system is able to make accurate predictions with more than 96\% accuracy, ensuring that all camera images are treated. Thanks to Evern, it is possible to locate invasive species faster and send warnings to take appropriate action, helping to protect local species.
